11b) double check testing coverage.
11c) package into jar
11d) Write up and Hand In


12) add gui for synth.
12a) add gui for changing root note
12b) add third note

13) add gui for changing scale (& pointer to it)
14) add gui for changing spectrum (& pointer to it)
15) mark names of major intervals
16) emphasise major interval lines



17) Size of dots is perhaps not clear enough indicator. Add colour scale as well?


19) third dimension - switch to 3 notes, change root note by scale interval

-- Reduce ratios to lowest form (octave shifter)

BEFORE HAND IN:
    !!!!!!COMMENT!!!!

 add minimum roughness for better scaling?
 prevent from redrawing grid unless size changes?

Scale - refactor to deal with ET.
      - refactor to deal with "just" scales for arbitrary inharmonic spectra
